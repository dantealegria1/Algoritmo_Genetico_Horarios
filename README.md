    <h1>Evolutionary Algorithm for School Timetable Creation</h1>
    <h2>Optimization of University Timetables using Evolutionary Algorithms</h2>
    <p>
        The implementation of evolutionary algorithms for the creation of an ideal school timetable is an innovative and efficient solution to manage the complexity of university schedules. This approach considers multiple important criteria to ensure the best academic experience for both students and professors. The criteria used include:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hours per week</li>
        <li>Subjects per day</li>
        <li>Professor availability</li>
        <li>Classroom allocation</li>
        <li>Type of classrooms (labs, auditoriums, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These algorithms iteratively evolve to find the best combination of these factors, adapting and improving continuously until achieving an optimal timetable that meets all the constraints and needs of the university group.
    </p>
    <h3>Advantages of the Evolutionary Approach</h3>
    <p>
        The use of evolutionary algorithms in timetable creation has several key advantages:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Ability to adapt to last-minute changes in the availability of professors or classrooms.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Reduction in the time required to generate complex schedules compared to manual methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimization:</strong> Generation of timetables that maximize resource utilization and minimize conflicts.</li>
        <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Ability to adjust the algorithm to consider specific preferences of students and professors.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The application of evolutionary algorithms in the planning of school timetables not only improves the efficiency and accuracy of the process but also provides a powerful tool for effectively managing educational resources. This method represents a significant advancement in educational administration, ensuring that timetables are as optimal and equitable as possible.
